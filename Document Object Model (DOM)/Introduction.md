You'll be learning so many things in this course! Here are the topics for each lesson:

- Lesson 1 - The Document Object Model
- Lesson 2 - Creating Content with JavaScript
- Lesson 3 - Working with Browser Events
- Lesson 4 - Performance

In Lesson 1, we'll take a dive into what the Document Object Model (DOM) is, how it gets created, and how we can access it with JavaScript.

In Lesson 2, you'll learn to interact with page content using JavaScript. You'll use the skills gained from the first lesson to JavaScript and the DOM to update existing page content, create new page content, add new content to the page, programmatically remove page content, and finally how to style page elements.

In Lesson 3, you'll learn about browser events. There is an entire world of thousands of browser events that are happening when you interact with a website. You can't see them directly, but you'll learn about them, how to listen for them, and how to respond when they occur.

In Lesson 4, you'll learn about Performance. It's never too early to start thinking about the performance implications of code. In this course we'll be writing code that can drastically change website (both its content and its looks!), so we need to make sure that the code we write is both functional and efficient.

As you can see, this course is packed with a ton of information! I hope you're excited to begin! üëç
